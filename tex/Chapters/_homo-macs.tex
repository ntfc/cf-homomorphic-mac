\section{Homomorphic MACs}\label{subsec:def-hmac}
The symmetric analogue of homomorphic signatures are homomorphic MACs.
%
Basically, Alice has a secret key which is used to generate a tag $\sigma$ that
authenticates a message $m$ under label $\tau$. Given a labeled program $\calP
= (f, \tauSpace{1}{n})$ and a set of tags $\sigmaSpace{1}{n}$, anyone can
execute the homomorphic evaluation algorithm over $\calP(\sigmaSpace{1}{n})$ to
generate a short tag $\sigma'$ that authenticates $m' = \calP(\mSpace{1}{n})$
as the output of the $\calP$ executed over inputs labeled by $\tauSpace{1}{n}$,
respectively.

There are three main properties that a homomorphic MAC scheme is required to
satisfy.%
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item It must be \emph{secure}, i.e., an adversary that asks for tags
  authenticating some messages of his own choice should not be able to produce
  valid tags authenticating messages that are not obtained as the output of
  $\calP$.
\item It should be \emph{succinct}, i.e., the output of $\calP$ can be
  certified using much less communication that than of sending the original
  authenticated messages.
\item Lastly, it should be \emph{composable} meaning that tags authenticating
  previous outputs of $\calP$ should be usable as inputs to further
  authenticate new computations, i.e., the tag authenticating the output of
  $\calP$ can be used as one of the inputs of another labeled program $\calP'$.
\end{inparaenum}

However, unlike in homomorphic signatures, it is necessary to explain what it
really means to authenticate a message as the output of a labeled program.
%
In a scenario where many users share the secret key and authenticate various
data-items without keeping any local or joint state, it is necessary to specify
which data is being authenticated and which data the program $\calP$ should be
evaluated on.
%
With this in mind, \textcite{gennaro:wichs:2012} defined the concept of
\emph{labeled programs}\footnote{\citeauthor{gennaro:wichs:2012} defined
labeled programs for boolean circuits $\function{f}{\{0, 1\}^n}{\{0,1\}}$, but
here we will consider the case for arithmetic circuits
$\function{f}{\bbF^n}{\bbF}$ where $\bbF$ is some finite field, like $\bbZ_p$
for some prime $p$.}.

\paragraph*{Labeled Programs} \emph{Labels} are used to index some data.
A labeled program $\calP = (f, \tauSpace{1}{n})$ consists of
a circuit\footnote{Or function.} $\function{f}{\bbF^n}{\bbF}$  and a distinct
input label $\tau_i \in \{0,1\}^\lambda$ for each input wire $i \in
\{\interval{1}{n}\}$ of the circuit. This can be seen as way to give useful
names to the variables of a program, without knowing the input values -- as an
example, we can consider a program that outputs the average salaries of
a company, and each $\tau_i$ can be of the form ``salary of worker $i$''.
%
A message $m$ is then authenticated with respect to a label $\tau$, and the
value of the label does not need to have any meaningful semantics. This
label-message association basically means that the value $m$ can be assigned to
those input variables of a labeled program $\calP$ whose label is $\tau$.
However, with this definition, a label \emph{cannot} be re-used for multiple
messages, i.e., two distinct messages $m, m'$ cannot be authenticated with
respect to the same label $\tau$. 

Given some labeled programs $\setSpace{\calP}{1}{t}$ and a circuit
$\function{g}{\bbF^t}{\bbF}$, the \emph{composed program} $\calP^*
= g(\setSpace{\calP}{1}{t})$ consists in evaluating a circuit $g$ on the
outputs of $\setSpace{\calP}{1}{t}$. The labeled inputs of the composed program
$\calP^*$ are just all the \emph{distinct} labeled inputs of
$\setSpace{\calP}{1}{t}$, and all the input wires with the same label are put
together in a single input wire.  The \emph{identity program} with label $\tau$
is denoted by $\calI_\tau := (g_{\id}, \tau)$, where $g_{\id}$ is the
\emph{canonical identity circuit} and $\tau \in \{0, 1\}^\lambda$ is some input
label. Any program $\calP = (f, \tauSpace{1}{n})$ can be written as
a composition of programs $\calP = f (\setSpace{\calI}{\tau_1}{\tau_n})$.

Given a labeled program $\calP = (f, \tauSpace{1}{n})$ and a set of tags
$\sigmaSpace{1}{n}$ that authenticates messages $m_i$ under label $\tau_i$
, anyone can run the homomorphic evaluation algorithm that takes an input the
tuple $(\calP, \sigmaSpace{1}{n})$ and whose output $\sigma'$ will authenticate
$m'$ as the output of $\calP(\mSpace{1}{n})$\footnote{To be more precise,
$\sigma'$ only certifies $m'$ as the output of a specific program $\calP$.}.
Then the secret-key verification algorithm takes as input the triple $(m',
\calP, \sigma')$ and verifies that $m'$ is indeed the output of the program
$\calP$ executed over some previously authenticated and labeled data, without
knowing the value of the original data.

\begin{definition}\label{def:hmac}
  A \emph{homomorphic message authenticator scheme} $\HMAC$ is a tuple of PPT
  algorithms (\KeyGen, \Auth, \Vrfy, \Eval), where $\calM$ defines a message
  space, as follows:
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\KeyGen(1^\lambda) \to (\ek, \sk)$:] Takes a security
      parameter $\lambda$. Outputs a public evaluation key \ek and a secret key
      \sk.
    \item[$\Auth_\sk(\tau, m) \to \sigma$:] Receives an input-label
      $\tau \in \{0, 1\}^\lambda$ and a message $m \in \calM$, and outputs a tag
      $\sigma$.
    \item[$\Vrfy_\sk(m, \calP, \sigma) \to \{\mathsf{accept},
      \mathsf{reject}\}$:] Receives a message $m \in \calM$, a labeled program
      $\calP = (f, \discretionary{}{}{}\tauSpace{1}{n})$ and a tag $\sigma$,
      and outputs either \textsf{accept} or \textsf{reject}.
    \item[$\Eval_\ek(f, \vec{\sigma}) \to \sigma'$: ] Receives
      a circuit $\function{f}{\calM^n}{\calM}$ and a vector of tags
      $\vec{\sigma} = (\sigmaSpace{1}{n})$ , and outputs a new tag $\sigma'$.
  \end{description}
\end{definition}

A homomorphic MAC scheme must achieve the following properties: authentication
and evaluation correctness, succinctness and security.

\paragraph*{Authentication correctness} For any $m \in \calM$, all keys $(\ek,
\sk) \gets_\$ \KeyGen(1^\lambda)$, any label $\tau \in \{0,1\}^\lambda$, and
any tag $\sigma \gets_\$ \Auth_\sk(\tau, m)$, it holds:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hmac-auth-corr}
  \Pr[\Vrfy_\sk(m, \calI_\tau, \sigma) = \mathsf{accept}]
  = 1.
\end{equation}

\paragraph*{Evaluation correctness} For a pair $(\ek, \sk) \gets_\$
\KeyGen(1^\lambda)$, a circuit $\function{g}{\calM^t}{\calM}$ and any set of
triples $\{\left( m_i, \calP_i, \sigma_i \right)\}_{i = 1}^t$ such that
$\Vrfy_\sk(m_i, \calP_i, \sigma_i) = \mathsf{accept}$. If $m^*
= g(\mSpace{1}{t})$, $\calP^* = g(\setSpace{\calP}{1}{t})$, and $\sigma^*
= \Eval_\ek(g, (\sigmaSpace{1}{t}))$, then it must hold:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hmac-eval-corr}
  \Vrfy_\sk(m^*, \calP^*, \sigma^*) = \mathsf{accept}.
\end{equation}

\paragraph*{Succinctness} The size of a computed tag is bounded by some fixed
polynomial in the security parameter $\poly(\lambda)$ which is independent of
the number $n$ of inputs taken by the evaluated circuit.

\paragraph*{Security} A homomorphic MAC scheme has to satisfy the following
notion of unforgeability.
\begin{definition}
  A homomorphic MAC scheme $\HMAC = (\KeyGen, \Auth, \Vrfy, \Eval)$ is
  \emph{unforgeable} if the advantage of any PPT adversary $\calA$ in the
  following game is negligible in the security parameter $\lambda$.
  \begin{description}
    \item[Setup] The challenger generates $(\ek, \sk) \gets_\$
      \KeyGen(1^\lambda)$ and gives the evaluation key \ek to $\calA$. It also
      initializes a list $Q = \emptyset$.
    \item[Authentication queries] The adversary can adaptively ask for tags on
      label-message pairs of her choice. Given a query $(\tau, m)$, if there is
      some $(\tau, m') \in Q$ for some $m' \neq m$, then the challenger ignores
      the query.
      %
      Otherwise, it computes $\sigma \gets \Auth_\sk(\tau, m)$, returns
      $\sigma$ to $\calA$ and updates the list $Q = Q \cup (\tau, m)$. If
      $(\tau, m) \in Q$ (i.e., the query was previously made), then the
      challenger returns the same tag generated before.
    \item[Verification queries] The adversary has access to a verification
      %oracle. $\calA$ can submit a query $(m, \calP, \sigma)$ and the
      oracle. $\calA$ can submit a query $(\tuple{m, \calP, \sigma})$ and the
      challenger replies with the output of $\Vrfy_\sk(m, \calP, \sigma)$.
    \item[Forgery] Eventually, the adversary outputs a forgery $(m^*, \calP^*
      = (f^*, \setSpace{\tau^*}{1}{n}), \sigma^*)$. Notice that such tuple can
      also be returned by $\calA$ as a verification query $(m^*, \calP^*,
      \sigma^*)$.
  \end{description}
  % Queries are not saved in Q because Auth is probabilistic
  Before describing the output of this game, it is necessary to define the
  notion of a well-defined program with respect to a list $Q$.
  %
  This notion intends to capture formally, which tuples generated by the
  adversary $\calA$ should be considered as valid forgeries. Because we are
  dealing with a homomorphic primitive, it should be possible to differentiate
  genuine tags produced by \Eval from tags produced in another, possibly
  malicious, way.
  %
  \paragraph*{Well-defined program} A labeled program $\calP^* = (f^*,
  \setSpace{\tau^*}{1}{n})$ is \emph{well-defined with respect to $Q$} if
  either one of the following conditions is met:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For some $i \in \{\interval{0}{n}\}$, there is a tuple $(\tau_i^*,
      \cdot) \notin Q$ (i.e., $\calA$ never asked authentication queries with
      label $\tau_i^*$), and $f^*(\{m_j\}_{(\tau_j, m_j) \in Q} \cup
      \{\tilde{m}_j\}_{(\tau_j, \cdot) \notin Q})$ outputs the same value for
      all possible values of $\tilde{m}_j \in \calM$. This means that the
      inputs $\tilde{m}_j$ do not affect the behavior of $f^*$ \footnote{
        Equivalently, it states that $f^*(\{m_j\}_{(\tau_j, m_j) \in Q}
        \cup\{\tilde{m}_j\}_{(\tau_j, \cdot) \notin Q})$ is semantically
        equivalent to $f^*(\{m_j\}_{(\tau_j, m_j) \in Q})$.}.

    %\item For $i = \{0, \dotsc, n\}$, all tuples $(\tau_i^*, m_i)$ are in $Q$.
    \item $Q$ contains tuples $(\tau_i^*, m_i)$ for some messages
      $\mSpace{1}{n}$, i.e., the entire input space of $f^*$ has been
      authenticated.
  \end{enumerate}
  The adversary $\calA$ wins if $\Vrfy_\sk(m^*, \calP^*, \sigma^*)
  = \mathsf{accept}$ and either:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Type I forgery:} $\calP^*$ is not well-defined on $Q$ or,
    \item \emph{Type II forgery:} $\calP^*$ is well-defined on $Q$ and $m^*
      \neq f^*(\{m_j\}_{(\tau_j, m_j) \in Q})$, which means that $m^*$ is not
      the correct output of the labeled program $\calP^*$ when executed on
      previously authenticated messages $(\mSpace{1}{n})$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

%The aim of defining the notion of a well-defined program is to capture,
%formally, which tuples generated by the adversary $\calA$ should be considered
%as forgeries.
%
%But since we are dealing with a homomorphic primitive, we
%should be able to differentiate genuine tags produced by \Eval from tags
%produced in another, possibly malicious, way.
Notice, however, that even maliciously generated tags should not necessarily be
considered as forgeries.  This is because the adversary $\calA$ can trivially
modify a circuit $C$ she is allowed to evaluate, by adding dummy gates and
inputs that are simply ignored in the evaluation of the modified circuit. This
does not constitute an infringement of the security requirements because the
notion of a well-defined program $\calP$ captures this exact case: either
$\calP$ is run on legal inputs (i.e., inputs in $Q$) only, or, if this is not
the case, those inputs not queried (i.e., the dummy inputs not in $Q$) do not
affect the computation in any way.

The previous security definition is very similar to the one from fully
homomorphic MACs of \textcite{gennaro:wichs:2012}, except for two
modifications.  Here it is explicitly allowed to the adversary to query the
verification oracle, and forgeries are slightly different.
In~\cite{gennaro:wichs:2012}, Type I forgeries are defined as ones where at
least one new label is present, and Type II forgeries contain only labels that
have been queried, but $m^*$ is not the correct output of $\calP$ when executed
over previously authenticated messages.

For arbitrary computations, there is no efficient way to check whether
a program is well-defined with respect to a list $Q$. The main problem is to
check the first condition, i.e., whether a program always outputs the same
value for all possible choices of inputs that were not queried. However, for
the case of arithmetic circuits defined over the finite field $\bbZ_p$, where
$p$ is a prime of roughly $\lambda$ bits, and whose degree is bounded by
a polynomial, this check can be efficiently performed. In a follow-up work by
\textcite{generalhmac}, it is noted that testing whether a program is
well-defined can be done for arithmetic circuits of degree $d$, over a finite
field $\bbF$ of order $p$ such that $\frac{d}{p} < \frac{1}{2}$.

As one can observe from the authentication queries phase of the previous game,
it is explicitly not allowed to re-use a label to authenticate more than one
value. This is basically a way to keep track of the authenticated inputs. This
is a restriction that has been present on all previous works on homomorphic
authentication primitives.

\textcite{backes:fiore:reischuk:2013} extended the notion of labeled programs
in order to solve the problem of label re-use. Their notion of
\emph{multi-labeled programs} allows the partial, but safe, re-use of labels.

\paragraph*{Multi-labeled Programs} A \emph{multi-labeled program}
$\calP_\Delta$ is a pair $(\calP, \Delta)$ where $\calP = f(\tauSpace{1}{n})$
is a labeled-program and $\Delta \in \{0, 1\}^\lambda$ is a binary string
denominated \emph{data set label}. Basically, the combination of a input label
$\tau_i$ and a data set label $\Delta$, defined as a multi-label $\mathsf{L}
= (\Delta, \tau_i)$, is used to uniquely identify a specific data item. In
particular, binding a message $m_i$ with a multi-label $\mathsf{L}
= (\Delta,\tau_i)$ means that $m_i$ can be assigned to those input variables
with input label $\tau_i$.  The multi-label \textsf{L} uniquely identifies the
message $m_i$. While the re-use of a multi-label \textsf{L} is not allowed, the
re-use of a input label $\tau_i$ is allowed, instead.
%
Composition of multi-labeled programs within the same data set is possible.
Given multi-labeled programs $(\calP_1, \Delta), \dotsc, (\calP_t, \Delta)$
having the same data set label $\Delta$, and given a function
$\function{g}{\calM^t}{\calM}$, the \emph{composed multi-labeled program}
$\calP^*_\Delta$ is the pair $(\calP^*, \Delta)$ where $\calP^*$ is the
composed program $g(\setSpace{\calP}{1}{t})$, and $\Delta$ is the data set
label shared by all $\calP_i$. If $\function{f_{\id}}{\calM}{\calM}$ is the
canonical identity function and $\mathsf{L} = (\Delta, \tau) \in (\{0,
1\}^\lambda)^2$ is a multi-label, then $\calI_\mathsf{L} = (f_{\id},
\mathsf{L})$ is the \emph{identity multi-labeled program} for data set $\Delta$
and input label $\tau$. Like in labeled programs, any multi-labeled program
$\calP_\Delta = ((f, \tauSpace{1}{n}), \Delta)$ can be expressed as the
composition of $n$ identity multi-labeled programs $\calP_\Delta
= (\setSpace{\calI}{\mathsf{L}_1}{\mathsf{L}_n})$ where $\mathsf{L}_i
= (\Delta, \tau_i)$.

Having defined the notion of a multi-labeled program, the definition of
a homomorphic message authenticator from \refdef{def:hmac} can be adapted to
support multi-labeled programs.

\begin{definition}
  A homomorphic message authenticator $\HMACML$ is a tuple of PPT algorithms
  (\KeyGen, \Auth, \Vrfy, \Eval), where $\calM$ defines a message space, as
  follows:
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\KeyGen(1^\lambda) \to (\ek, \sk)$:] Takes a security
      parameter $\lambda$. Outputs a public evaluation key \ek and a secret key
      \sk.
    \item[$\Auth_\sk(\mathsf{L}, m) \to \sigma$:] Receives
      a multi-label $\mathsf{L} = (\Delta, \tau) \in (\{0, 1\}^\lambda)^2$ and
      a message $m \in \calM$, and outputs a tag $\sigma$.
    \item[$\Vrfy_\sk(m, \calP_\Delta, \sigma) \to \{\mathsf{accept},
      \mathsf{reject}\}$:] Receives a message $m \in \calM$, a multi-labeled program
      $\calP_\Delta = ((f, \tauSpace{1}{n}), \Delta)$ and a tag $\sigma$, and
      outputs either \textsf{accept} or \textsf{reject}.
    \item[$\Eval_\ek(f, \vec{\sigma}) \to \sigma'$:] Receives a circuit
      $\function{f}{\calM^n}{\calM}$ and a vector of tags $\vec{\sigma}
      = (\sigmaSpace{1}{n})$, and outputs a new tag $\sigma'$.
  \end{description}
\end{definition}

\paragraph*{Authentication correctness} For any message $m \in \calM$, all keys
$(\ek, \sk) \gets_\$ \KeyGen(1^\lambda)$, any multi-label $\mathsf{L}
= (\Delta, \tau) \in (\{0,1\}^\lambda)^2$, and any tag $\sigma' \gets_\$
\Auth_\sk(\mathsf{L}, m)$, it holds:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hmac-ml-auth-corr}
  \Pr[ \Vrfy_\sk(m, \calI_\mathsf{L}, \sigma') = \mathsf{accept}] = 1.
\end{equation}

\paragraph*{Evaluation correctness} For a pair $(\ek, \sk) \gets_\$
\KeyGen(1^\lambda)$, a circuit $\function{g}{\calM^t}{\calM}$ and any set of
triples $\{(m_i, \calP_{\Delta, i}, \sigma_i\}_{i=1}^t$ such that all
multi-label programs $\calP_{\Delta, i} = (\calP_i, \Delta)$ and
$\Vrfy_\sk(m_i, \calP_{\Delta,i}, \sigma_i) = \mathsf{accept}$. If $m^*
= g(\mSpace{1}{t})$, $\calP^* = g(\setSpace{\calP}{1}{t})$, and $\sigma^*
= \Eval_\ek(g, (\sigmaSpace{1}{t}))$, then it must hold:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hmac-ml-eval-corr}
  \Pr[\Vrfy_\sk(m^*, \calP^*_\Delta, \sigma^*) = \mathsf{accept}] = 1.
\end{equation}

\paragraph*{Succinctness} The size of a computed tag is bounded by some fixed
polynomial in the security parameter $\poly(\lambda)$ which is independent of
the number $n$ of inputs taken by the evaluated circuit.

\paragraph*{Security} The security property is extended from
\textcite{catalano:fiore:2013} to the model of multi-labeled programs.
A homomorphic MAC scheme has to satisfy the following notion of unforgeability.
%
\begin{definition}
  A homomorphic MAC scheme $\HMAC = (\KeyGen, \Auth, \Vrfy, \Eval)$ is
  \emph{unforgeable} if the advantage of any PPT adversary $\calA$ in the
  following game is negligible in the security parameter $\lambda$.
  \begin{description}
    \item[Setup] The challenger generates $(\ek, \sk) \gets_\$
      \KeyGen(1^\lambda)$ and gives the evaluation key to $\calA$.
    \item[Authentication queries] The adversary can adaptively ask for tags on
      multi-labels and messages of her choice. Given a query $(\mathsf{L}, m)$
      where $\mathsf{L} = (\Delta, \tau)$, if this is the first query with data
      set $\Delta$, the challenger initializes a list $Q_\Delta = \emptyset$.
      Then, if $(\tau, m') \in T_\Delta$ for some $m' \neq m$, the challenger
      ignores the query.  Otherwise, if $(\tau, \cdot) \notin Q_\Delta$, the
      challenger computes $\sigma' \gets_\$ \Auth_\sk(\mathsf{L}, m)$,
      returns $\sigma'$ to $\calA$ and updates list $Q_\Delta = Q_\Delta \cup
      (\tau, m)$. If $(\tau, m) \in Q_\Delta$, then the challenger returns the
      same tag generated before.
    \item[Verification queries] The adversary has access to a verification
      oracle. $\calA$ can submit a query $(\tuple{m, \calP_\Delta, \sigma})$, and the
      challenger replies with the output of $\Vrfy_\sk(m, \calP_\Delta,
      \sigma)$.
    \item[Forgery] The game ends when $\calA$ returns a forgery $(m^*,
      \calP^*_{\Delta^*} = (\calP^*, \Delta^*), \sigma^*)$ for some $\calP^*
      = (f^*, \setSpace{\tau^*}{1}{n})$. Notice that such tuple can be returned
      by $\calA$ as a verification query $(m^*, \calP^*_{\Delta^*}, \sigma^*)$.
  \end{description}
  %
  Just as with labeled programs, it is necessary to define the notion of
  well-defined programs with respect to a list $Q_\Delta$. The notion is
  exactly the same as for labeled programs, except that now we are within
  a data set $\Delta$.
  
  \noindent The adversary $\calA$ wins the game if $\Vrfy_\sk(m^*, \calP^*_{\Delta^*},
  \sigma^*) = \mathsf{accept}$ and one of the following holds:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Type I Forgery}: no list $Q_\Delta^*$ was created, i.e., no
      message $m$ has been authenticated within data set label $\Delta^*$.
    \item \emph{Type II Forgery}: $\calP^*$ is well-defined with respect to
      $Q_{\Delta^*}$ and $m^* \neq f^*(\{m_j\}_{(\tau_j, m_j) \in Q_{\Delta^*}})$,
      i.e., $m^*$ is not the correct output of labeled program $\calP^*$ when
      executed on previously authenticated message $(\mSpace{1}{n})$.
    \item \emph{Type III Forgery}: $\calP^*$ is not well-defined with respect
      to $Q_{\Delta^*}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

This definition of security is similar to the one from
\textcite{catalano:fiore:2013} previously presented, but extended to the model
of multi-labeled programs.
%
Just as with labeled programs, it is not possible to check in polynomial time
if whether an arbitrary computation is well-defined with respect to a list $Q$,
but for the specific case of arithmetic circuits defined over the finite field
$\bbZ_p$ and of polynomial degree, this check can be efficiently performed.
% NOTE: it is possible to convert a type 3 into a type 2. This conversion is
% what makes the checking of a well-defined program efficient, right?

\paragraph*{Efficient Verification}The notion of multi-labels by itself does
not guarantee an efficient verification algorithm. To achieve this it is
necessary to introduce a property of efficient verification. This efficiency
property is defined in an amortized sense, meaning that the verification is
more efficient when the same program $\calP$ is executed on different data
sets.
%
To achieve efficient verification, the definition of a homomorphic MAC scheme
previously defined has to be augmented with two new algorithms.
\begin{definition}
  A homomorphic MAC scheme $\HMACML = (\KeyGen, \Auth, \Vrfy, \Eval)$ satisfies
  \emph{efficient verification} if there exist two additional algorithms
  (\VrfyPrep, \EffVrfy) as follows:
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\VrfyPrep_\sk(\calP) \to \vk_\calP$:] Given a labeled
      program $\calP = (f, \tauSpace{1}{n})$, it generates a \emph{concise}
      verification key $\vk_\calP$. This verification key does not depend on
      any data set label $\Delta$.
    \item[$\EffVrfy_{\sk, \vk_\calP}(\Delta, m, \sigma)$:] Given a data set
      label $\Delta$, a message $m \in \calM$ and a tag $\sigma$, it outputs
      either \textsf{accept} or \textsf{reject}.
  \end{description}
\end{definition}
These new algorithms need to achieve two properties: correctness and amortized
efficiency.

\paragraph*{Correctness} Let $(\ek, \sk) \gets_\$ \KeyGen(1^\lambda)$ be a pair
of honestly generated keys, and $(m, \calP_\Delta, \sigma)$ be any tuple
message/program/tag with $\calP_\Delta = (\calP, \Delta)$ such that
$\Vrfy_\sk(m, \calP_\Delta, \sigma) = \mathsf{accept}$. Then, for every
$\vk_\calP \gets_\$ \VrfyPrep_\sk(\calP)$, it holds that:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eff-vrfy-corr}
  \Pr[\EffVrfy_{\sk, \vk_\calP}(\Delta, m, \sigma) = \mathsf{accept}] = 1.
\end{equation}

\paragraph*{Amortized efficiency} Let $\calP_\Delta = (\calP, \Delta)$ be
a multi-labeled program, let $(\mSpace{1}{n}) \in \calM^n$ be any vector of
messages, and let $t(n)$ be the time required to compute
$\calP(\mSpace{1}{n})$. If $\vk_\calP \gets \VrfyPrep_\sk(\calP)$, then the
time required for $\EffVrfy_{\sk, \vk_\calP}(\Delta, m, \sigma)$ is $\calO(1)$
(independent of $n$).

In this efficiency requirement the cost of computing $\vk_\calP$ is not
considered. That is because the same $\vk_\calP$ can be re-used in many
verification operations with the same labeled program $\calP$, but many
different data sets $\Delta$. Given this, the cost of computing $\vk_\calP$ is
\emph{amortized} over many verifications of the same function on different data
sets.

\begin{comment}
\subsection{Homomorphic Evaluation of Arithmetic Circuits} Here we
follow~\cite{backes:fiore:reischuk:2013} to present some basic definitions
regarding the homomorphic evaluation of arithmetic circuits over values defined
in some appropriate set $\calJ \neq \calM$. Usually,
$\function{f}{\bbZ_p^n}{\bbZ_p}$, but sometimes the message space may be
defined in $\calJ$, and so it is necessary to obtain an equivalent algorithm
that evaluates messages from $\calJ$ over $f$.

\paragraph*{Homomorphic Evaluation over Polynomials} Consider that
$\calJ_{\poly} = \bbZ_p[x_1, \dotsc, x_m]$ is the ring of polynomials in
variables $x_1, \dotsc, x_m$ over $\bbZ_p$. For every tuple $\vec{a} = (a_1,
\dotsc, a_m) \in \bbZ_p^m$, let
$\function{\phi_{\vec{a}}}{\calJ_{\poly}}{\bbZ_p}$ be the function defined as
$\phi_{\vec{a}}(y) = y(a_1, \dotsc, a_m)$ for any $y \in \calJ_{\poly}$.
$\phi_{\vec{a}}$ is a homomorphism from $\calJ_{\poly}$ to $\bbZ_p$.
%
Given an arithmetic circuit $\function{f}{\bbZ_p^n}{\bbZ_p}$, there exists
another structurally equivalent circuit
$\function{\hat{f}}{\calJ_{\poly}^n}{\calJ_{\poly}}$ such that $\forall y_1,
\dotsc, y_n \in \calJ_{\poly} \colon \phi_{\vec{a}}(\hat{f}(y_1, \dotsc, y_n))
= f(\phi_{\vec{a}}(y_1), \dotsc, \phi_{\vec{a}}(y_n))$. The only difference is
that in every gate the operation in $\bbZ_p$ is replaced by the corresponding
operation in $\bbZ_p[x_1, \dotsc, x_m]$.

More precisely, for every positive integer $m \in \bbN$ and a given $f$, the
computation of $\hat{f}$ on $(y_1, \dotsc, y_n) \in \calJ^n_{\poly}$ can be
defined as $\PolyEval(m, f, y_1, \dotsc, y_n) \to \bbZ_p$. For every gate
$f_g$, on input two polynomials $y_1, y_2 \in \calJ_{\poly}$, proceeds as
follows: if $f_g = +$, it outputs $y = y_1 + y_2$ (adds all coefficients
component-wise); if $f_g = \times$, it outputs $y = y_1 \cdot y_2$ (uses the
convolution operator on the coefficients). Notice that every $\times$ gate
increases the degree $d$ of $y$, as well as its number of coefficients. If
$y_1, y_2$ have degree $d_1, d_2$ respectively, the degree of $y = y_1 \cdot
y_2$ is $d_1 + d_2$.

\paragraph*{Bilinear Groups} Let $\calG(1^\lambda)$ be an algorithm that on
input the security parameter $1^\lambda$, outputs the description of a bilinear
group $\bgpp = (p, \bbG, \bbG_T, e, g)$ where $\bbG$ and $\bbG_T$ are groups of
the same order $p > 2^\lambda$, $g \in \bbG$ is a generator and
$\function{e}{\bbG \times \bbG}{\bbG_T}$ is an efficiently computable bilinear
map, or pairing function. $\calG$ is a \emph{bilinear group generator}.

\paragraph*{Homomorphic Evaluation over Bilinear Groups} Let $\bgpp = (p, \bbG,
\bbG_T, e, g)$ be the description of a bilinear group as previously defined.
With a fixed generator $g \in \bbG$, then $\bbG \cong (\bbZ_p, +)$ (i.e.,
$\bbG$ and the additive group $(\bbZ_p, +)$ are isomorphic) by considering the
isomorphism $\phi_g(x) = g^x$ for every $x \in \bbZ_p$. Similarly, by the
property of the pairing function $e$, $\bbG_T \cong (\bbZ_p, +)$ by considering
the isomorphism $\phi_{g_T}(x) = e(g,g)^x$. Since both $\phi_g$ and
$\phi_{g_T}$ are isomorphisms, there also exist the corresponding inverses
$\function{\phi_g^{-1}}{\bbG}{\bbZ_p}$ and
$\function{\phi_{g_T}^{-1}}{\bbG_T}{\bbZ_p}$, even though these are not known
to be efficiently computable.

For every arithmetic circuit $\function{f}{\bbZ_p^n}{\bbZ_p}$ of degree at most
2, the $\GroupEval(f, X_1, \dotsc, X_n)$ algorithm homomorphically evaluates
$f$ with inputs in $\bbG$ and outputs in $\bbG_T$.

Basically, given a circuit $f$ of degree at most 2, and given an $n$-tuple of
values $(X_1, \dotsc, X_n) \in \bbG^n$, \GroupEval proceeds gate-by-gate as
follows: if $f_g = +$, it uses the group operation in $\bbG$ or in $\bbG_T$; if
$f_g = \times$, it uses the pairing function, thus ``lifting'' the result to
the group $\bbG_T$. By using only circuits of degree at most 2, the
multiplication is well defined.

\GroupEval achieves the desired homomorphic property:
\begin{theorem}\label{theo:group-eval-homo-prop}
  Let $\bgpp = (p, \bbG, \bbG_T, e, g)$ be the description of bilinear groups.
  Then, the algorithm $\GroupEval$ satisfies: $\forall(X_1, \dotsc, X_n) \in
  \bbG^n \colon \GroupEval(f, X_1, \dotsc, X_n) = e(g,g)^{f(x_1, \dotsc, x_n)}$
  for the unique values $\{x_i\}^n_{i=1} \in \bbZ_p$ such that $X_i = g^{x_i}$.
\end{theorem}
The proof of \reftheorem{theo:group-eval-homo-prop} can be found
in~\cite{backes:fiore:reischuk:2013}.

\subsection{Pseudo-Random Functions with Amortized Closed-Form Efficiency}
A \emph{closed-form efficient} PRF is just like a standard PRF, plus an
additional efficiency property. Consider a computation $\Comp(R_1, \dotsc, R_n,
\vec{z})$ which takes random inputs $R$ and arbitrary inputs $\vec{z}$, and
runs in time $t(n, |\vec{z}|)$. By considering the case where each $R_i
= \mathsf{F}_K(\mathsf{L}_i)$, then the PRF \textsf{F} is said to satisfy
closed-form efficiency for $(\Comp, \vec{\mathsf{L}})$ if, with the knowledge
of the seed $K$, one can compute $\Comp(\mathsf{F}_K(\mathsf{L}_1), \dotsc,
\mathsf{F}_K(\mathsf{L}_n), \vec{z})$ in time strictly less than $t$. The main
idea is that in the pseudo-random case all $R_i$ values have a shorter
closed-form representation (as a function of $K$), and this might also allow
for the existence of a shorter closed-form representation of the computation
\Comp.

From the above considerations it possible to define a new property for PRFs:
\emph{amortized close-form efficiency}. The idea is to address computations
where each $R_i$ is generated as $\mathsf{F}_K(\Delta, \tau_i)$. All the inputs
of \textsf{F} share the same data set label $\Delta$. Then, \textsf{F}
satisfies amortized closed-form efficiency if it is possible to compute $\ell$
computations $\{\Comp(\mathsf{F}_K(\Delta_j, \tau_1), \dotsc,
\mathsf{F}_K(\Delta_j, \tau_n), \vec{z})\}^\ell_{j = 1}$ in time strictly less
than $\ell \cdot t$.

A PRF is defined as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item[$\KeyGen(1^\lambda) \to (\pp, K)$:] Given a security parameter,
    output a secret key $K$ and some public parameters $\pp$ that specify
    domain $\calX$ and range $\calR$ of the function.
  \item[$\F_K(x) \to R$:] Receives $x \in \calX$ and uses the secret
    key $K$ to compute a value $R \in \calR$.
\end{description}
A PRF must satisfy the pseudo-randomness property. More precisely, (\KeyGen, \F)
is \emph{secure} if for every PPT adversary $\calA$ it holds:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:amor-closed-form-prf-sec}
  \abs*{\Pr[\calA^{\F_K(\cdot)}(1^\lambda, \pp) = 1]
  - \Pr[\calA^{\phi(\cdot)}(1^\lambda, \pp) = 1]} \leq \negl(\lambda)
\end{equation}
$(K, \pp) \gets_\$ \KeyGen(1^\lambda)$, and
$\function{\phi}{\calX}{\calR}$ is a random function.

\begin{definition}\label{def:amort-closed-form-eff-prf}
  Consider a computation $\Comp(R_1, \dotsc, R_n, z_1, \dotsc, z_m)$ with
  random $n$ input values and $m$ arbitrary input values. \Comp takes time
  $t(n,m)$. Let $\vec{\mathsf{L}} = (\mathsf{L}_1, \dotsc, \mathsf{L}_n)$ be
  arbitrary values in the domain $\calX$ of \textsf{F} such that $\mathsf{L}_i
  = (\Delta, \tau_i)$. A PRF (\KeyGen, \F) satisfies \emph{amortized
  closed-form efficiency} for $(\Comp, \vec{\mathsf{L}})$ if there exist
  algorithms $\CFEval^\off_{\Comp, \vec{\tau}}$ and $\CFEval^\on_{\Comp,
  \Delta}$ such that:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Given $\omega \gets \CFEval^\off_{\Comp, \vec{\tau}}(K,
      \vec{z})$, then
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:prf-acf-eff-1}
        \CFEval^\on_{\Comp, \Delta}(K, \omega) = \Comp(\F_K(\Delta, \tau_1),
        \dotsc, \F_K(\Delta, \tau_n), z_1, \dotsc, z_m)
      \end{equation}
    \item The running time of $\CFEval^\on_{\Comp, \Delta}(K, \omega)$ is
      $o(t)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
The $\omega$ obtained from the offline computation $\CFEval^\off_{\Comp, \tau}$
does not depend on data set label $\Delta$, which means that it can be re-used
in further online computations $\CFEval^\on_{\Comp, \Delta}(K, \omega)$ to
compute $\Comp(\F_K(\Delta, \tau_1), \dotsc, \F_K(\Delta, \tau_n), \vec{z})$
for many different $\Delta$'s.
%
Because of this, the efficiency property puts a restriction only on
$\CFEval^\on_{\Comp,\Delta}$ in order to capture the idea of achieving
efficiency in an amortized sense when considering many evaluations over of
$\Comp(\F_K(\Delta, \tau_1), \dotsc, \F_K(\Delta, \tau_n), \dotsc, \vec{z})$,
with different data set label $\Delta$ in each evaluation. Essentially, one can
pre-compute $\omega$ once, and then use it to run the online phase as many
times as needed, almost for free.

The structure of \Comp may impose some restrictions on the range $\calR$ of the
PRF, and due to the pseudo-randomness property, the output distribution of
$\CFEval^\on_{\Comp, \Delta}(K, \CFEval^\off_{\Comp, \vec{\tau}}(K, \vec{z}))$
is computationally indistinguishable from the output distribution of
$\Comp(R_1, \dotsc, R_n, \vec{z})$.
