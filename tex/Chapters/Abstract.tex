  \noindent Currently, cloud computing is very appealing because it allows the
  user to outsource his data so it can later be accessed from multiple devices.
  The user can also delegate to the cloud computing service provider some,
  possibly complex, operations on the outsourced data. Since this service
  provider may not always be trusted, it is necessary to not only preserve the
  privacy but also to enforce the authenticity of the outsourced data.  Lately,
  a lot of work was put on solving the first problem, specially after the
  introduction of the first Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme. In this work
  we will focus on the latter, namely on the use of Homomorphic Message
  Authentication primitives. We will evaluate the current available solutions,
  their functionality and their security. Finally, we will provide an
  implementation of one of these schemes in order to verify if they are indeed
  practical.
